In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting.

The high level goals of the relicensing effort are to:
Encourage ongoing contributions to LLVM by preserving a low barrier to entry for contributors. Protect users of LLVM code by providing explicit patent protection in the license. Protect contributors to the LLVM project by explicitly scoping their patent contributions with this license. Eliminate the schism between runtime libraries and the rest of the compiler that makes it difficult to move code between them.</description></item><item><title>Sponsors</title><link>https://foundation-new.llvm.org/docs/sponsors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation-new.llvm.org/docs/sponsors/</guid><description>Sponsors Join our sponsors!
